# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
Repository for the course assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera.

The first file, Downloading and Unzipping Dataset.R, is the file which initializes the project.
In this script, we download and unzip the dataset, and then take things a step further and
then read and assigned the data in the dataset text files, so that we could use them later on
in a different script in R. 

In run_analysis.R, we do the preparation and tidying of the data, following the steps
outlined in the assignment description, and at then end, are left with a nice, clean, 
tidy data set which can be found in Final Data in R.
